    "## 1. Heating of Cooling of a Semi-Infinite Half-Space\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we learned about Lord Kelvin's approach to assess the age of the Earth by assuming the solution of a cooling semi-infinite half-space. Basically, he assumed that the specific heat flow at the surface is the result of a cooling process from below. In the beginning, he assumed, Earth had the same hot temperature which is still present at its core.  \n",
    "As we saw in the exercise, his approach is flawed because he did not consider / did not know about concepts like radiogenic heat generation in the mantle or thermal convection (solid-state) in the mantle.   \n",

    "$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\kappa \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, this solution can also be used for determining the thermal structure of oceanig lithosphere. At a MOR (Mid Ocean Ridge), new hot crust is exposed to cold sea water. With time and seafloor spreading, rocks near the interface between seafloor and water cool down and lose their heat to the water. "

    "In a semi-infinite half-space defined with x > 0, we can obtain the solution to the scenario above by solving the equation above. At t=0, the lithosphere (half-space) has its original temperature $T_0$. Now, at the interface to the water (the *surface*), the temperature changes to a lower temperature $T_1$ at times $t > 0$. That causes a cooling from above, i.e. heat flowing upwards towards the surface.  \n",

    "As stated above, the half-space solution can be used to model the cooling of oceanic lithosphere. The bottom of said lithosphere, which is moving horizontally with a velocity $v$ above the mantle, can be seen as an isotherm. So, the lithosphere is a package, moving relative to the mantle, and bounded by the surface (seafloor), and an isotherm (around 1600 K). The lithosphere thickens over time, so the isothermal boundary at its bottom will be deeper the older the lithosphere is. Due to the seafloor spreading at a MOR, age is also a function of velocity. With a constant spreading-velocity, the lithosphere at a distance $x$ to the MOR can be considered Y years old.  \n",
