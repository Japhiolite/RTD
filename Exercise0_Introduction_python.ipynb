    "plt.plot(x,y,'-') # line plot\n",
    "plt.plot(x,y,'.') # point plot\n",
    "plt.plot(x,y,'o') # circles, i.e. bigger points\n",
    "plt.plot(x,y,'d') # diamonds\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you use different data sets in one plot, you'll need an option to distinguish between those data sets. You can do this via the symbol as above, the plot color, and a label (in order to add a legend).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y, '.-', color=[.4,.8,.4], label='1st data')# point-line with RGB color and label \"1st data\"\n",

    "plt.legend() # calls a legend to be visible in the plot\n",
    "```\n",
